# responsive-portfolio-basic

## description:
The goal was to recreate the [portfolio project](https://github.com/chenallee/portfolio) and make it responsive, using mostly Bootstrap. Check it out [here](https://chenallee.github.io/responsive-portfolio-basic/portfolio.html).

## made in Visual Studio using:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## final thoughts:
Although I didn't write as much in the CSS stylesheet, most of the project involved trial and error in regards to styling. It was nice to let Bootstrap's classes do most of the heavy lifting there, but I'm sure it will annoy me when I need to create something with a more complex design. Still, I was able to finish this much quicker by utilizing Boostrap so I'll consider it as an option.
